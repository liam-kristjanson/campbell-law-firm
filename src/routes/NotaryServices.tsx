                                A notary can notarize a document in a foreign language if they are confident the signers understand the content. Some jurisdictions may have specific requirements, so it's advisable to check local laws.

                                If there are errors, the document may need to be notarized again. Always review the document carefully before and after notarization to ensure accuracy.
